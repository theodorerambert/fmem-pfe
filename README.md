# fmem-pfe
A simple Perl Tk frontend for the Fmem kernel module, part of the Foriana Package. This script will detect and copy the amount of memory available or the amount that the user specifies. The file will be saved as the current date-memory.dd in a directory that the user chooses.

Future versions may include:
A text area for notes
A progress bar (though bandwidth is usually ~ 120 MB/s)
Use nc to transfer mem dumps 


Fmem is Part of the Foriana Package released under the GPL
